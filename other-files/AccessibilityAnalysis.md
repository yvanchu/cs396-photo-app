# What corrections did you have to make?

1. I had to make the anchor link text darker to meet the guideliens
2. I had to change my hrefs to unique links, for which i set it to the profile url of the posters.
3. I had empty button and form issues, for which i fixed using the aria-label tag.
4. I had suspicious link text issue, for which i fixed by making the "read more" more descriptive, like "read more captions"

# Given that the photos and captions rely on user-generated content, do you think that the accessibility problems are all solvable? Why or why not?

I believe that they are all solvable especially with the rise of machine learning and photo classification for alt text. I am also optimistic that the future of interfacing will give rise to more efficient nonvisual interfaces for users of all abilities.

# Do you think your website is usable if you turn off the CSS? Why or why not?

It is usable because I organized my html in a logical manner.

# Do you think your website is usable if you turn off the images? Why or why not?

not really because my alt texts are not accurate descriptions of the randomly generated images.
